Interface localization
======================

QBzr uses gettext library for i18n support. 
Available translations resides in po/ subdirectory of the tree.
QBzr expects to load binary mo-files from locale/ subdirectory
of the tree.

To generate translation POT-template file you need to run command:
	python setup.py build_pot

All existing PO-files will be updated as well.

To compile translations to binary mo-files you need to run command:
	python setup.py build_mo

NOTE: windows installer ships with latest compiled translation inside.

Help translate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can help to translate QBzr interface to other languages.

You can use either Launchpad trnaslations interface (it's preferable way) 
see https://translations.launchpad.net/qbzr,
or you can translate it offline, see instructions below.

First at all you need to download from 
http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~qbzr-dev/qbzr/trunk/files
either `po/qbzr-XX.po` (where XX is your language and country code) 
or `po/qbzr.pot` if there is no po-file for your language yet.

Then you need to translate it either using any suitable text editor 
with UTF-8 support or with tools like Poedit (http://www.poedit.net/)  
or KBabel (http://kbabel.kde.org/).

When you're finish please file a bug report at
https://launchpad.net/qbzr/+filebug and attach the translated file.
