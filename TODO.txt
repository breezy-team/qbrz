TODO List
=========
Todo items, feature requests, wishes, and wild ideas.

 - allow changing of location in qbrowse -- is it really needed? [bialix]
 - tabbed (per file) qdiff view
 - more information in qblame (like gblame) -- needs more details [bialix]
 - pluggable API for adding pages to qconfig from other plugins

 - faster qdiff on big binary files: provide small optimization re binary
   files:
     
     1) try to get content of binary file from working tree first
     2) if it's really binary file and it's not image file then skip
        reading its content from revision tree/repository
     3) support for binary settings in rules file (global/local does not
        matter), e.g. 
        
         * rule name: ``binary``, 
         * possible values: ``auto`` (default, require content check),
           ``yes`` (force binary mode, no need to check content),
           ``no`` (force text mode, no need to check content)
