Gettext usage in QBzr
*********************
Overview
--------
QBzr uses the standard Python/GNU gettext library to create 
localized interface. To use gettext functions you should import 
the bzrlib.plugins.qbzr.lib.i18n module.

Functions
---------
i18n.py module provides the following functions:

gettext(message)
	return translated message as unicode string.

ngettext(singular, plural, n)
	do plural form lookup and return corresponding translation 
        as unicode string.

N_(message)
	return message itself.

install()
	enable translations

uninstall()
	disable translations

By default translations are disabled, and therefore gettext() 
and ngettext() functions return original untranslated message.

To enable translations you should call i18n.install() function.
This function is called automatically for all q-commands.

N_() and gettext()
------------------
Function N_() has only one purpose: mark some string for translation,
so GNU xgettext utility can extract such string from source code.
It does effectively nothing and always returns its argument.
Function N_() should be called only for a string literal and never
for a variable.

gettext() main purpose is to do message translation lookup
when translations are enabled. Its second purpose is to mark some string
for translation, so GNU xgettext utility can extract such string
from source code.

Function gettext() can be called either for a string literal or for a variable.
Argument to gettext() can be either plain string or unicode, but always
in ascii-encoding. Function gettext() always returns an unicode string.

Valid usage of these functions:

====================  ================================================
N_(message)           -> message without transformation
gettext(message)      -> translated message (as unicode)
gettext(variable)     -> translated message from variable (as unicode)
gettext(N_(message))  -> translated message (as unicode)
====================  ================================================

Incorrect usage:

=========================  ======================
N_(N_(message))            -> message
N_(gettext(message))       -> translated message
gettext(gettext(message))  -> translated message
=========================  ======================

Although such usage don't raise runtime error, but never use it in such manner.

How to use gettext() and N_()
-----------------------------
Simple rules:

   - use N_() at import time, that is, for global and class definitions
   - use gettext() inside functions
   - in the tests gettext() always returns original (non-translated) string

Always call gettext() for strings that will appear [verbatim] in GUI forms.

If you need to have both original and translated string (e.g. original string used as
dictionary key etc.) then use N_() for declaring such original string, and later
call gettext() to obtain translated string. See also:
http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Special-cases.html
(replace gettext_noop() in those examples with N_()).
