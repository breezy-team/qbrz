Building NSIS installer for using QBzr with standalone bzr.exe
==============================================================

To build NSIS installer you need NSIS program itself and you
need to provide PyQt4 libraries for Windows Python 2.5.

PyQt4 libraries should be placed to ``./installer/_lib`` directory.
Usually you can copy them from your Windows Python 2.5 ``site-packages``
directory. You need files from ``PyQt4`` directory and ``sip.pyd`` as well.

To build installer you need to run command from tree root::

	python setup.py bdist_nsis

NSIS is able to run on Linux platform, so in theory this command should
work even on Linux.

On Windows you can ask setup.py to copy necessary PyQt4 libs for you
with command-line option --copy-pyqt4::

	python setup.py bdist_nsis --copy-pyqt4

Resulting installer will appear in tree root with name
``qbzr-setup-X.Y.Z.exe``.
