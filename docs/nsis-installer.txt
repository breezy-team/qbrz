Building NSIS installer for using QBzr with standalone bzr.exe
==============================================================

To build NSIS installer you need NSIS program itself and you
need to provide PyQt4 libraries for Windows Python 2.5.

To build installer you need to run command from tree root::

	python setup.py bdist_nsis

NSIS is able to run on Linux platform, so in theory this command should
work even on Linux.

Resulting installer will appear in tree root with name
``qbzr-setup-X.Y.Z.exe``.


Additional libraries
--------------------
To copy all required libraries from your Python 2.5 installation
you could use --copy-all option::

	python setup.py bdist_nsis --copy-all

PyQt4 (mandatory)
*****************
PyQt4 libraries should be placed to ``./installer/_lib`` directory.
Usually you can copy them from your Windows Python 2.5 ``site-packages``
directory. You need files from ``PyQt4`` directory and ``sip.pyd`` as well.

On Windows you can ask setup.py to copy necessary PyQt4 libs for you
with command-line option --copy-pyqt4.

Pygments (optional)
*******************
Pygments library should be placed to ``./installer/_lib`` directory.
Usually you can copy it from your Windows Python 2.5 ``site-packages``
directory. You need also standard module ``commands.py`` from Python 2.5
``Lib`` directory because it's not pre-packaged into bzr.exe.

On Windows you can ask setup.py to copy necessary Pygments libs for you
with command-line option --copy-pygments. This will copy ``pygments``
package and ``commands.py`` module as well.
