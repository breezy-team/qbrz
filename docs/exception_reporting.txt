Exception reporting in QBzr
***************************
Overview
========
QBzr has a global exception handler. This will either report the exception
to the command line, or show a dialog with the error. The behaviour of this
can be modified to suit the area of the program.

Modes
=====
There are 3 different modes for the exception reporting: (In the code, these
are called "type")


MAIN_LOAD_METHOD
----------------
The behaviour of this mode depends on whether the window is in ui_mode or not.
If in ui_mode, the window is closed, and the report is written to the console.
If not in ui mode, the report is displayed in a dialog. This dialog only has
one button - "Close", which closes both this dialog, and the window.

This mode should be used for initial window loading methods, where if the method
fail, then the dialog would be useless, and hence gets closed every time.

SUB_LOAD_METHOD
---------------
The behaviour of this mode is to show the report in a dialog, with just a close
button. When the close button is clicked, the report dialog is closed, but not
the window.

The mode should be used for methods where you are executing an action, or
loading data from user input provided in the gui, e.g. when you open a branch,
and the location is from a text edit. In these cases, you need to tell the user
that there was an error, but allow the user to continue working.

ITEM_OR_EVENT_METHOD
--------------------
The behaviour of this mode is to show the report in a dialog, with just a close
and a ignore button. When the close button is clicked, the report dialog and the
window are closed. If the ignore button is pressed, just the report dialog is
closed.

If no mode it specified by the method below, then the global exception handler
uses this as the default, and hence covers alot of unexpected errors. It gives
the user the option to ignore a minor error, and continue working.

Controlling the mode
====================
You can either decorate your method with @reports_exception, which wraps your
method in a try..except for every time is is called. Or you can have your own
try..except, and call report_exception in the except. Both of these except a
type parameter, with MAIN_LOAD_METHOD as the default.

E.g.::

    @reports_exception() 
    def load(self):
    
    @reports_exception(type=SUB_LOAD_METHOD)
    def refresh(self):
    
    try:
        self.tree.add(paths)
    except Exception:
        report_exception(type=SUB_LOAD_METHOD, window=self.window())
