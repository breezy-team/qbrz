Short checklist and instructions how to make release
====================================================

When you're ready to make release X.Y.Z you need to do
following steps.

Prepare code
------------
1. Update ./NEWS.txt with descriptions of user-visible changes.
2. Update version numbers in following places:

   * ./__init__.py: at the beginning of file::
   
   	version_info = (X, Y, Z, 'final', 0)
   
   * ./setup.py: function setup() at the end of file, argument version::
   
   	version='X.Y.Z',

   * ./installer/qbzr-setup.iss: at the beginning of file::
   
   	AppVerName=QBzr X.Y.Z
    
    OutputBaseFilename=qbzr-setup-X.Y.Z
   
3. Commit this changes and tag the revision with label: release-X.Y.Z
4. Push the code to Launchpad


Register release at Launchpad
-----------------------------
1. Make corresponding page for new release on Launchpad:

	https://launchpad.net/qbzr/trunk/+addrelease
        
2. Put info about release from ./NEWS.txt to "Release notes" section.
   You can leave Changelog section empty.


Build distribution files
------------------------
1. Make source code tarball::

	bzr export --root=qbzr qbzr-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
        
   The file qbzr-X.Y.Z.tar.gz will be created in tree root directory.
   Sign this file with your GPG key::
   
   	gpg -ab qbzr-X.Y.Z.tar.gz

2. Build binary translations files::

	python setup.py build_mo -f

3. Make Windows Python-based installer::

	python setup.py bdist_wininst -d.

   This command will produce qbzr-X.Y.Z.win32.exe file in tree root directory.
   Sign this file with your GPG key::
   
   	gpg -ab qbzr-X.Y.Z.win32.exe

4. Make Windows Standalone installer::

	python setup.py bdist_nsis --copy-all
        
   This command will produce qbzr-setup-X.Y.Z.exe file in tree root directory.
   Sign this file with your GPG key::
   
   	gpg -ab qbzr-setup-X.Y.Z.exe

   **Note**: if you have PyQt 4.3.x installed then you need to change one line
   in qbzr-setup.nsi file::
   
       === modified file 'installer/qbzr-setup.nsi'

5. Upload tarball and installers with their gpg-signatures to Launchpad:

	https://launchpad.net/qbzr/trunk/X.Y.Z/+adddownloadfile


Update QBzr Wiki page
---------------------
1. Update QBzr page at Bazaar wiki with corresponding NEWS entry,
   update links to tarball and installers.
   
   	http://bazaar-vcs.org/QBzr


Make announcement
-----------------
1. Send short e-mail with announcement to:
    * <bazaar-announce@lists.canonical.com>
    * (optionally) <bazaar@lists.canonical.com>
    * <qbzr@googlegroups.com>

2. Optionally make announcement about release via Launchpad RSS:

	https://launchpad.net/qbzr/+announce


Finishing stuff at Launchpad
----------------------------
