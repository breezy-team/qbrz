   	version='X.Y.Z',

	python setup.py build_mo -f

3. Make Windows Python-based installer::

   Sign this file with your GPG key::
   
   	gpg -ab qbzr-X.Y.Z.win32.exe

	python setup.py bdist_nsis
        
   This command will produce qbzr-setup-X.Y.Z.exe file in 'installer' directory.
   Sign this file with your GPG key::
   
   	gpg -ab qbzr-setup-X.Y.Z.exe

5. Upload tarball and installers with their gpg-signatures to Launchpad:
