0.23.0 "Birch" - 2012/07/12
---------------------------
What's new in this release:

QBzr 0.23 is companion release for bzr 2.6, and compatible with bzr 2.5.

Behavior change: External diff behavior is changed as below.(IWATA Hidetaka)
 1. When calling external diff for multiple files, all diffs shown at once.(Bug #942218)
 2. Working tree or branch is locked only when starting up of diff tools.(Bug #942221)
This affects to all commands which use external diff. 
(qdiff, qcommit, qbrowse, qannotate, ...)

Now, you can launch 'Shelve' directly from each dialog when uncommitted change blocks action.
And you can launch 'Resolve' directly when conflicts generated. (IWATA Hidetaka #935903)

New feature of qannotate command: command-line option `--line=N` (`-L`) 
allows you to jump right to specific line. 
That could be used for tighter integration with editors and IDEs.

Annotation window now uses e-mail of revision author to define background 
color of revision. Previously we've used author name to define background 
color, so changes in different revisions made by user with the same e-mail 
but with differently spelled name was highlighted with different colors.

Simple actions to resolve conflicts: 'take "THIS"' and 'take "OTHER"'.
Available from context menu.

Show simple message box instead of exception report dialog when failing to lock. (#935902)

Improvements of qlog's context menus: better context menu of deleted files,
and for files from virtual "Working Tree" revision (available when
qlog run with --show-tree option). Also properly refresh the state of changes
in virtual "Working Tree" revision.

 * qannotate:
   * New command-line option `--line=N` (`-L`) to activate specified 
     line number on start of dialog. (Alexander Belchenko)
   * Prefer e-mail as "author id" to define background color for lines.
     (Alexander Belchenko, Bug #878204)
 * qbind:
   * Add push location to suggestions. (Alexander Belchenko)
 * qconflicts:
   * Added 2 resolve actions to context menu: `Take "THIS"` 
     and `Take "OTHER"`. (Alexander Belchenko)
   * Auto-refresh conflicts list after selecting a resolve action.
     (Alexander Belchenko)
 * qlog:
   * Disable context menu items (view, annotate, save) for deleted files.
     (Alexander Belchenko, Bug #1009876)
   * Fix - Some menus (show tree, view, annotate) don't work when Working
     tree revision selected.

     (IWATA Hidetaka, Bug #1020530)
   * Fixing issue: Working tree revision is never refreshed.
     (IWATA Hidetaka, Bug #1021076)
 * qrevert:
    * it now does a real check to see if there are files (or merges) selected to revert -
      if not, it shows a warning message. (André Bachmann, Bug #942744)
 * qshelve/qunshelve:
   * Use `encoding` settings from branch or global config to properly show 
     files content. (Alexander Belchenko, Bug #995943)

0.21 "Tilia" - 2011/07/21
-------------------------
What's new in this release:

QBzr 0.21 is companion release for bzr 2.4, and compatible with bzr 2.3.
New features in this release:

Now you can select changes to shelve and unshelve your saved changes with
new shiny qshelve and qunshelve dialogs.

qdiff window has been reworked and all controls moved to a toolbar, similar to
one in qannotate window. Also qdiff toolbar provides you new functions: text
search within active pane and also knob to ignore whitespace changes (it's 
also available as command-line option).

User can configure the tab width and this setting affects qdiff, qannotate and
qcat windows. By default tab width equals to 8 characters, user can set new
default value in bazaar.conf as ``tab_width = N`` (either via qconfig or
editing [DEFAULT] section of bazaar.conf). Also user can set individual tab
width for branches in their branch.conf. User can configure tab width via
"View Options" menu in toolbars of qdiff, qannotate.

QBzr provides support for new builtin feature of bzr: mergetools. Now you can
easier configure your favorite diff/merge tool to be used from qconflicts or
context menu in qbrowse (Working Tree browser in Bazaar Explorer).

If you have python-gpgme installed and you have enabled gpg-signatures for
your commits then you can see new messages regarding valid gpg-signatures
available in qlog. Also you can run check of your signatures with new
qverify-signatures command.

Other changes include major rework of qinfo dialog (show the same information
as CLI ``bzr info`` does), qcommit dialog now remembers state of "Show
non-versioned" knob between runs, now it's possible to save old state of the
file from qlog dialog (using context menu in file list), error dialogs has been
improved (now also support apport if available) 
and several other improvements and bugfixes (see full changelog for details).

Changes after 0.21 beta 1:

 * qcat:
   * Fixed problem with viewing file from qbrowse.
     (Alexander Belchenko, Bug #776196)
 * qinfo:
   * Turned off word-wrap in location label: prevents strange
     path display if there are spaces in the path.
     (A. S. Budden, Bug #781040)
   * Fixed UnicodeError for non-ascii paths.
     (Alexander Belchenko, Bug #790138)
 * qdiff, qannotate:
   * Tab-width can be customised from the view menu.
     (Bug #490377, A. S. Budden)
 * qgetnew:
   * The target location no longer gets overwritten 
     when the source location changes. (André Bachmann)
 * qlog:
   * File list context menu: added support to save content of a file 
     of specific revision as a new file. (André Bachmann)
   * Show digital signature information for commits if python-gpgme is
     installed
 * Improved error dialogs on internal/other error, 
   support for apport (if it's available).

   * Fixed UnicodeDecodeError with non-ascii paths in target directory
     picker. (Alexander Belchenko, Bug #789083)

   and qconflicts. (Bug #489915, Gordon Tyler)
 * New qshelve / qunshelve dialogs. (IWATA Hidetaka)
 * New command qverify-signatures to show digital signature statuses
   for branch commits


0.21 beta 1 - 2011/05/02
------------------------

 * qbranch:
   * Fixed problem with very small width of input fields in the dialog
     on Mac OSX. (Timothy Reaves, Bug #667090)
 * qbrowse:
   * Use `qcat --native` equivalent to allow opening copies of files from
     branches without working trees. (A. S. Budden, Bug #752422)

   * Remember "Show non-versioned" checkbox state. 
     (Nick Sonneveld, Bug #258926)
 * qconflicts:
   * Fixed internal error when there is conflict in non-versioned file.
     (Alexander Belchenko, Bug #655451)
 * qdiff:
   * New toolbar with controls and options (similar to qannotate's toolbar).
     (Dorin Scutarașu)
   * Support for ignore whitespace differences in changes. 
     This mode can be turned on from command-line (`qdiff -w` 
     or `qdiff --ignore-whitespace`) and from GUI itself (in View Options).
     (Dorin Scutarașu, Glen Mailer, Bug #642000)
   * Added Find action to do text search within either pane.
     (Dorin Scutarașu, Bug #497832)
 * qinfo:
   * Significantly simpler implementation that shows the information

     by qinfo (such as details of checkouts) and means that changes
     to 'bzr info' will automatically be reflected in qinfo.
     (A. S. Budden, Bug #439624)

   * Reliable exception encoding to pass exception attributes

 * qcat, qannotate, qdiff, qconfig:

     affects qcat, qannotate and qdiff).
     The setting is stored in [DEFAULT] section of bazaar.conf,
     and is named tab_width (it can also be configured with qconfig).  Units
     are characters (so 4 means a tab should be displayed with the width of 4
     spaces).  The default value is 8.  The setting can also be adjusted in
     branch.conf for specific branches.  (Bug #490377, A. S. Budden)

 * Full list of all contributors added to AUTHORS.txt.
 * Most q-commands those change state of the branch or working tree
   (e.g qcommit, qadd, qpull etc.) now return exit code 0 when operation 
   finished successfully, and exit code 1 when dialog/operation was canceled.

   and in uncommit hook (#380896, #328636). On uncommit it also saves
   beginning and end revision ids of uncommitted chain of revisions
   in addition to old tip revision message and bug ids. All data saved
   as dictionary in "commit_data" section of branch.conf.
 * Disabled decoration of merge command with --qpreview option (#395817).
