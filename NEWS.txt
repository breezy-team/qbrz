0.14.4 - In Devlopment
----------------------

* qcommit/qrevert: Fixed a bug were the pending merges graph was being loaded
                   twice. (Gary van der Merwe)


0.14.3 - 2009-10-02
-------------------
Bugfixes release.

 * qcommit:
    * Fixed bug with inability of run qcommit /path/to/tree/root after merge.
      (#433137, Alexander Belchenko)

      (Gary van der Merwe)

     already installed the QUIFactory(). A branch can be a lightweight checkout
     of a remote location which requires a password. Which wants to open a UI
     dialog, which causes a crash because QApp has not been created yet.

0.14 "Eucalyptus" - 2009-08-21
-------------------------------
What's new in this release: 

 * we have 5 new dialogs (qbind, qunbind, qexport, qplugins and quncommit).
 * better help for plugin itself (now `bzr help qbzr` gives you
   useful info).
 * qcommit and uncommit hook now can store revision message and
   information about bugfixes for revision, this information automatically
   restored on next qcommit run in this branch.
 * most q-commands now able to return exit code 0 when operation 
   finished successfully, and exit code 1 when dialog/operation was canceled.
 * `merge --qpreview` feature has disabled.
 * qmerge now supports uncommitted and forced merging.
 * Dozen bugfixes and small improvements.

Detailed changelog:

 * New dialogs: 
    * qbind, qexport, qunbind (Javier Derderian)
    * qplugins, quncommit (Ian Clatworthy)
 * Renamed [hidden] command qbzr to qmain.
 * Better help for plugin itself.
 * Full list of all contributors added to AUTHORS.txt.
 * Most q-commands those change state of the branch or working tree
   (e.g qcommit, qadd, qpull etc.) now return exit code 0 when operation 
   finished successfully, and exit code 1 when dialog/operation was canceled. 
   Commands those only show information about branch/tree or the bzr itself
   (e.g. qlog, qdiff, qversion) always return exit code 0.
 * Now QBzr can save and restore bug ids information on qcommit cancel
   and in uncommit hook (#380896, #328636). On uncommit it also saves
   beginning and end revision ids of uncommitted chain of revisions
   in addition to old tip revision message and bug ids. All data saved
   as dictionary in "commit_data" section of branch.conf.
 * Disabled decoration of merge command with --qpreview option (#395817).
 * qmerge now supports forced merging and merging of uncommitted changes.
   (#400062, #409865)
 * qinfo now works on shared repositories (#385105)

(require bzr 1.17); better support of unicode paths in various commands.

 * qbranch: now it's possible to branch into newly created empty directory.
 * qgetupdates: new alias: qgetup

 * qupdate: new command as simple front-end for stadard `bzr update`
 * qversion: new command to display Bazaar & Python installation information

     (The code for this is reused from qlog.)
   * Add a item to the revision list context menu to annotate a older revision.
 * qbrowse:
   * It is now possible to browse a working tree. The change status of file is
     shown.

                           number. E.g:
